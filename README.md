# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv5/YOLOv8

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **real-time object detection** using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models. It captures live video from a webcam and detects objects using **YOLOv5** or **YOLOv8** depending on user selection.

The detection results are displayed on the video stream with annotated bounding boxes and labels.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔥 Supports **YOLOv5** and **YOLOv8** models
- 🎥 Real-time object detection using a webcam
- 📦 Pretrained models for accurate detection
- 🖼️ Annotated video output with detected objects
- ✅ Option to easily switch between YOLO versions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV** for webcam access and image processing
- **PyTorch** for YOLOv5 model
- **Ultralytics YOLO** package for YOLOv8 model
